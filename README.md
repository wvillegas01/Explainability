#  SoftwareX - Explainability
==================================================== ======
Algorithm for Explainability in AI Systems
Code-Data
==================================================== ======

This repository contains the code used in the article "Explainability in AI Systems: A Practical Approach through Code and Interactive Visualization." The regulation provides a practical example of developing explainability software in Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems.

## Repository Content

- `trained_model.h5`: File containing the trained model used in the article.
- `explicabilidad.py`: Python code that demonstrates the implementation of explainability techniques, such as attention and Permutation Importance, to analyze and visualize the model's behavior.
- `data/`: Folder containing the CSV files that load the Formula 1 race data.

## Requirements

-Python 3.x
- Required libraries: pandas, sci-kit-learn, TensorFlow, matplotlib

## Instructions for use

1. Clone this repository to your local machine: `git clone https://github.com/your-user/repository-name.git`
2. Install the required libraries: `pip install -r requirements.txt.`
3. Run the `explainability.py` file to see the practical example of explainability in AI systems.
